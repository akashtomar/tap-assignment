## Tap Assigment

> MySql table create cammands are present in base.sql file
> Credentials are harcoded for this POC (can be moved to env vars easily)




### command install packages
`npm i`

### command to execute this code
`node app.js`   

### Output will be saved to tables created in base.sql


## TODO: (enhancements that I can think of for later)
> moving creds and other table names to config/env vars (hardcoded now)
> more testing and checking in transactions are needed
> migrating to using an orm if logics gets more complicated moving forward
